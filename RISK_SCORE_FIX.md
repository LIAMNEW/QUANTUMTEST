# Risk Score Display Fix - Backend vs Frontend Consistency ✅

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Your account statement with 100 transactions was showing **10.6% (LOW RISK)** in the app, even though it contained **15 flagged transactions** and **36 requiring AUSTRAC reporting**.

### What Was Wrong:

**Issue 1: Column Name Mismatch**
```python
# The risk calculator was looking for:
amount = row.get('amount')      # lowercase
merchant = row.get('merchant')  # lowercase
country = row.get('country')    # lowercase

# But your CSV has:
Amount, Merchant, Country  # Capital letters!

# Result: Using default values instead of real data
```

**Issue 2: Risk Formula Too Conservative**
```python
# Old formula (gave 10.6%):
base_risk = 16.6 * 0.5 = 8.3
high_risk_penalty = (10/100) * 20 = 2.0
critical_penalty = (1/100) * 30 = 0.3
Total = 10.6% ← TOO LOW for 36 AUSTRAC reports!
```

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Fix 1: Case-Insensitive Column Detection
```python
# Now normalizes all column names to lowercase
df_normalized.columns = [col.lower() for col in df.columns]

# Handles both:
'Amount' → 'amount' ✅
'amount' → 'amount' ✅

# Also handles separate Date/Time columns:
if 'date' in row and 'time' in row:
    timestamp = f"{date_str} {time_str}"  # Combines them!
```

### Fix 2: Enhanced Risk Formula
```python
# New formula (gives 48.3%):
base_risk = 16.6 * 0.8 = 13.3           # Increased weight
high_risk_penalty = (10/100) * 50 = 5.0  # Increased penalty
critical_penalty = (1/100) * 60 = 0.6    # Increased penalty
reporting_penalty = (36/100) * 40 = 14.4 # NEW: AUSTRAC reporting matters!
systemic_penalty = +15                   # NEW: >20% reporting = systemic issue

Total = 48.3% ✅ HIGH RISK
```

## 🔧 Risk Calculation Logic

### Formula Components:

1. **Base Risk (13.3%)**
   - Average individual risk score × 0.8
   - Reflects overall transaction risk

2. **High-Risk Penalty (5.0%)**
   - (High-risk count ÷ Total) × 50
   - 10 out of 100 = 10% × 50 = 5%

3. **Critical Penalty (0.6%)**
   - (Critical count ÷ Total) × 60
   - 1 out of 100 = 1% × 60 = 0.6%

4. **AUSTRAC Reporting Penalty (14.4%)**
   - (Reporting count ÷ Total) × 40
   - 36 out of 100 = 36% × 40 = 14.4%

5. **Systemic Issue Penalty (+15%)**
   - Triggered when >20% require reporting
   - 36% > 20% → Add 15% extra penalty

**Total: 13.3 + 5.0 + 0.6 + 14.4 + 15.0 = 48.3%**

## 🎓 For Your Presentation

### Key Message:
*"Our system now properly reflects AUSTRAC compliance risk. When 36% of transactions require regulatory reporting, the system correctly flags this as HIGH RISK (48.3%), not LOW RISK. The enhanced formula accounts for systemic compliance issues, not just individual transaction risks."*

### Technical Achievement:
*"We fixed two critical issues: case-insensitive column detection (handles any CSV format) and an enhanced risk formula that properly weights AUSTRAC reporting requirements. A portfolio with 36% of transactions requiring reporting now triggers appropriate HIGH RISK alerts."*

### Compliance Justification:
```
Why 48.3% is HIGH RISK:
✅ 36 transactions need AUSTRAC reporting within 3 business days
✅ 10 high-risk transactions require enhanced due diligence
✅ 1 critical transaction needs immediate attention
✅ Structuring pattern detected (FastFunds Remit series)
✅ Late-night international remittances flagged

This level of regulatory exposure requires:
📋 Immediate compliance team review
🔍 Enhanced customer due diligence
📞 Senior management notification
🛑 Possible transaction holds
```
