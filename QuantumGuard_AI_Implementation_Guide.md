## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Using Replit Agent Effectively

**Best Practices for Prompts:**

1. **Be Specific About Integration Points**
   ```
   "Extend the existing austrac_classifier.py by adding a new method called 
   generate_pdf_report() that uses reportlab to create official AUSTRAC reports. 
   The method should accept a transaction classification dict and return a PDF file."
   ```

2. **Request Incremental Changes**
   ```
   "First, add the database models for the case management system to database.py. 
   Then create case_management.py with CRUD operations. Finally, add the UI in a 
   new tab in app.py."
   ```

3. **Specify Testing Requirements**
   ```
   "After implementing the real-time alerting system, create test cases that verify:
   - Alerts trigger when risk score > 0.7
   - Email notifications are sent correctly
   - Alert history is stored in database
   Include sample test data"
   ```

4. **Ask for Documentation**
   ```
   "Update the replit.md file to document the new API endpoints, including request/
   response examples and authentication requirements"
   ```

### Development Workflow

**Weekly Sprint Pattern:**
1. **Monday:** Define feature scope, write prompts for Replit Agent
2. **Tuesday-Thursday:** Implement features via Agent, test incrementally  
3. **Friday:** Integration testing, bug fixes, documentation updates
4. **Weekend:** User testing, gather feedback
